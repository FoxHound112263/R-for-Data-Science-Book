# Introduction

- What type of variation occurs within my variables?
- What type of covariation occurs between my variables?

# Variation

Variation is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement from measurement.

# Visualising distributions

To examine the distribution of a categorical variable use a bar chart
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

You can compute the values manually with dplyr

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  count(cut)
```

To examine the distribution of a continuous variable use a histogram

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5)
```

Can also be computed manually

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  count(cut_width(carat, 0.5))
```
